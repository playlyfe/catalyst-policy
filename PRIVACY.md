# Catalyst Privacy Policy

Effective Sep 21, 2018. [Document History](#document-history)

This Policy applies to all Playlyfe websites, products and services, and any point of contact you might have with Playlyfe. "Catalyst" and "Catalyst Services" are offered by Playlyfe.

We define the following as our "Catalyst Services":
- The Catalyst Website (https://getcatalyst.in)
- The Catalyst Web Application hosted on your subdomain - your-organization.getcatalyst.in

This document is a sister-document to our [Terms of Service](https://signup.getcatalyst.in/legal/terms) document. Please make sure you read both carefully before accessing or using a Catalyst Service.

## Our Commitment to Privacy
We are committed to being good citizens. We consider protecting and respecting your personal information as an essential part of that responsibility.

This Privacy Policy describes the what, how, and whys of collecting your information. To make it easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where we request personally identifiable information.

In this Privacy Policy, we sometimes refer to "you". "**You**" may be a visitor to Catalyst Website, or a user of our Catalyst Web Application. We’ll do our best to clarify who we are referring to at various points in the policy.

Our Catalyst Web Application also includes the concept of an Organization Owner, or Administrator. For the rest of this document, they will collectively be referred to as **Owners**.

This Privacy Policy also describes your choices regarding how your data is used, and how you can access, update, or delete this information.

We only collect **the minimum amount** of personal information necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us; we keep it only for as long as we have valid reasons to keep it; we never sell or rent it to third parties; and we only use it as this Privacy Policy describes.

Our business model is a very traditional one: we provide products and services, and customers pay us for them. In other words, you are the customer, NOT the product.

## Your Privacy Choices and Rights

### Collected Data
You have the following choices and rights with regards to **Collected Data** for which Playlyfe is the Data Controller.

#### Your choices

- **You can choose not to provide us with personal data.** If you choose to do this, you can continue to use the Catalyst Website and  browse its pages, but we will not be able to process transactions on the Catalyst Web Application without your personal data.

- **You can turn off cookies in your browser by changing its settings.** You can block cookies by activating a setting on your browser allowing you to refuse cookies. You can also delete cookies through your browser settings. If you turn off cookies, you can continue to use the Catalyst Website and browse its pages, but certain services (like Intercom) will not work effectively.

- **You can ask us not to use your data for marketing.** We will inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for marketing and if third parties are involved. You can opt out from marketing by emailing us at help@getcatalyst.in.

#### Your rights

**You have the right to access information we hold about you.**
This includes the right to ask us supplementary information about:

- the categories of data we’re processing
- the purposes of data processing
- the categories of third parties to whom the data may be disclosed
how long the data will be stored (or the criteria used to determine that period)
your other rights regarding our use of your data

We will provide you with the information within one month of your request, unless doing so would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other (e.g. another person’s confidentiality or intellectual property rights). We’ll tell you if we can’t meet your request for that reason.

**You have the right to make us correct any inaccurate personal data about you.**

**You can object to us using your data for profiling you or making automated decisions about you.**
We may use your data to determine whether we should let you know information that might be relevant to you (for example, tailoring emails to you based on your behaviour). Otherwise, the only circumstances in which we will do this is to provide Catalyst Services to you.

**You have the right to port your data to another service.**
We will give you a copy of your data in CSV or JSON so that you can provide it to another service. If you ask us and it is technically possible, we will directly transfer the data to the other service for you. We will not do so to the extent that this involves disclosing data about any other individual.

You can do this by asking us to erase any personal data we hold about you, if it is no longer necessary for us to hold the data for purposes of your use of Catalyst Services.

**You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding our use of your data.**
Please tell us first, so we have a chance to address your concerns. If we fail in this, you can address a complaint to your local Data Protection Authority.

### Service Data

We only process **Service Data** as per our Customer's instructions. For purposes of the GDPR, we are the processor and not the controller of the Service Data. All Personal Data collected during the use of the Catalyst Web Application through a Catalyst Organization account belonging to our Customers is considered as Service Data.

If you are our Customer, then in your role as a controller, you are authorizing, on behalf of you and your authorized agents and End Users, and representing that you have the authority to provide such authorization to the processing and transfer of Personal Data in and to the United States and other countries which may have different privacy laws from your or their country of residence. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that the Service Data is treated securely.

We do not own, control or direct the use of Service Data, and in fact we are largely unaware of what information is being stored on our platform and only access such information as reasonably necessary to respond to support requests, as otherwise authorized by Customers or as required by law. Unless we explicitly agree otherwise in writing, you will not process sensitive personal data (such as health data) on our platform.

If you seek access to, or wish to correct, update, modify or delete Personal Data which is part of the Service Data and processed by us on behalf of our Customer, you should direct your query to our Customer i.e, the controller. If you are a Customer of the Catalyst Web Application and wish to raise a Request on behalf of your Users and End Users in connection with Service Data, you can send us an email at help@getcatalyst.in.

## Sub-Processors

Tech businesses often use third parties to host their applications, communicate their customers, power their emails, etc. We partner with third-parties who we believe are the best in their field at what they do.

When we do this, sometimes it is necessary for us to share your data with them in order to get these services to work well. Your data is shared only when strictly necessary and according to the safeguards and good practices detailed in this Privacy Policy. Where personal data is transferred to a third party in the United States we take steps to ensure that the organization in question has a current certification with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (ITA).
