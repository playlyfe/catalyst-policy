This Agreement applies to:

- The Catalyst Website (getcatalyst.in)
- The Catalyst Web Application hosted on your subdomain - your-organization.getcatalyst.in

This document is a sister-document to our **[Privacy Policy](https://signup.getcatalyst.in/legal/privacy)**. Please make sure you read both carefully before accessing or using a Catalyst Service.

---

## Introduction

### English, Not Legalese

Most Terms of Service and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.

Because **we believe in establishing long-term relationships with our customers**, we decided to use plain English instead as much as possible, to make our terms as clear as possible.

Please don’t forget that we are real people: take a look at [our company page](https://getcatalyst.in/about) to get to know us a little. We are not perfect, but we’re trying our hardest, because we genuinely care about your success.

When you read **Playlyfe** or **we** below, it refers to Playlyfe as defined in the [Who We Are](https://signup.getcatalyst.in/legal/privacy#who-we-are) section of [our Privacy Policy](https://signup.getcatalyst.in/legal/privacy)


Our Catalyst Web Application also include the concept of an Organization Owner, or Administrator. For the rest of this document, these will collectively be referred to as **Owners**.

Should you have other questions or concerns about this document, please [get in touch](https://signup.getcatalyst.in/legal/privacy#contact-us)

## Using Our Services Means Accepting These Terms

By accessing or using a Catalyst Service in any way, whether you are visiting our websites, have created your own Catalyst Organization or are invited to someone else’s Organization as a user, you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document, the [Data Processing Addendum](https://signup.getcatalyst.in/legal/dpa) as well as our [Privacy Policy](https://signup.getcatalyst.in/legal/privacy).

If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this document and our Privacy Policy, do not access a Catalyst Service.

This is a living document. With your help, we want to make it the best in the industry.

If you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or if you think of something that should be added, please get in touch! We’re all ears!

We don’t amend this document for any particular customer, but if your changes apply to all of our customers, we’ll be happy to update it for everyone. Scroll to the bottom to see the history so far.

We improve this document over time. If the changes are significant, we will provide a prominent notice on our home page, product login screens, or by sending you an email notification. By continuing to use the Service, you will implicitly accept the changes we make.

Your access and use of the Catalyst Services is always subject to the most current version of this document.

## Support

Support for Catalyst is provided via email at help@getcatalyst.in.

Chat and phone support is also included, but **only provided to Owners**.

**Owners are responsible for first-level support** to the people in their Catalyst Organization. If you have an issue with your Catalyst Service, contact your Owner(s) first.

We continuously update our documentation so that users can help themselves and Owners are better equipped to help their users.

We take pride in providing excellent customer support, but we are also a small team and value our work/life balance. This means that although we’ll try our best, **we do not guarantee 24/7 support**.

## System Requirements

## Intellectual Property Rights

### Who Owns Catalyst Materials?

**Catalyst Materials** are all the information, data, documents (e.g. white papers, press releases, datasheets, FAQs, etc.), communications, downloads, files, text, images, photographs, graphics, videos, webcasts, publications, content, tools, resources, software, code, programs and products on the Catalyst Services produced by Playlyfe.

Catalyst Materials are protected by copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and all other intellectual property and proprietary rights, and any unauthorized use of the Catalyst Materials may violate such laws and the Terms of Service.

You agree not to copy, republish, frame, download, transmit, modify, adapt, create derivative works based on, rent, lease, loan, sell, assign, distribute, display, perform, license, sublicense or reverse engineer the Catalyst Services or Catalyst Materials or any portions of them.

You agree that you will not decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the software. Any copying or redistribution of the software is prohibited, including any copying or reproduction of the software to any other server or location for further reproduction, redistribution or use on a service bureau basis. Any unauthorized use, copying or distribution of the software is expressly prohibited by law, and may result in severe civil and criminal penalties. Violators will be prosecuted to the maximum extent possible.

The trademarks, logos and service marks displayed on the Services are the property of Playlyfe or other third parties. You are not permitted to use them without the prior written consent of Playlyfe or such third-party that may own the Marks. Playlyfe, the Playlyfe logo, and the Catalyst logo are trademarks of Playlyfe IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

* Catalyst Materials may not be modified or altered in any way.
* Catalyst Materials on Catalyst may not be distributed or sold, rented, leased, licensed or otherwise made available to others.

* Catalyst reserves the right to revoke the authorization to view, download and print the Catalyst Materials available via Catalyst Services at any time, and any such use shall be discontinued immediately upon notice from Playlyfe.
* The rights granted to you constitute a license and not a transfer of title.
* Any Catalyst Materials made available only upon payment of a fee may only be viewed, downloaded and printed subject to your payment of such fee.

### Who Owns the IP of My Data?

Playlyfe does not claim intellectual property rights over the data uploaded on Catalyst nor the assets your users upload.

For the Catalyst Web Application, we leave it to each Catalyst Organization Administrator(s) to decide who should own the IP of the data on their Catalyst Organization. We encourage Organization Administrator(s) to make their policy clear to their Organization’s users, either via email or any other form convenient to them.

You acknowledge and agree that Playlyfe has no liability of any kind should anyone you granted access to your content modify, destroy, corrupt, copy or distribute it, or violate the terms of use or other limitations that you may impose on the use of your shared content.

Playlyfe does not pre-screen user materials that users provide or otherwise submit via Catalyst Services; however, Playlyfe may remove any posted or submitted user materials from Catalyst Services for any reason without notice in its sole discretion. By posting or submitting your user materials, you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the intellectual property rights and other rights to your user materials as described in these Terms of Service, including all the rights necessary for you to post or submit your user materials.

In addition, by posting or otherwise submitting your user materials that contain images, photographs, pictures, videos, webcasts or that are otherwise graphical in whole or in part (“Images”), you represent and warrant that: (a) you own the copyright in such Images, or that you have obtained all necessary license(s) from the copyright owner(s) of such Images to use such Images, or portions thereof, in keeping with your use in connection with Catalyst Services and as otherwise permitted by these Terms of Service; (b) in the event you choose to grant licenses and sublicenses to such Images, you have the rights necessary to grant the licenses and sublicenses described in these Terms of Service; and (c) you have received consent from any and all persons depicted in such Images to use the Images as set forth in these Terms of Service, including the distribution, public display, public performance and reproduction of such Images.

You are solely and entirely responsible for all of your user materials that you post or otherwise submit via Catalyst Services. You shall assume all risks associated with the use of your user materials including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of your user materials. Playlyfe does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of your user materials. You acknowledge and agree that by accessing or using Catalyst Services, you may be exposed to user materials from others that are offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable.

## Reliability

### Do You Guarantee That Catalyst Services Will Be Accessible at All Times?

In short, we do not. Like all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet. We do not offer contracted SLA for availability to Catalyst Services and your data.

That said, high reliability is something we are proud of and something we deliberately chose to compete on. We have developers, system administrators and support staff on call, 24 / 7.

We monitor Catalyst closely and have set up automated alarms to be notified (via email and SMS) when the Catalyst service is under stress, so that we can deal with the issue before it becomes a problem that might impact customer access.

You acknowledge and agree that Playlyfe shall not be liable for any failure to store your materials on Catalyst Services at any time.

## Play Nice Clauses

### Use of Catalyst Services

You agree that you shall not:

* Collect, harvest, mine or engage in any other activity to obtain e-mail addresses, phone numbers, personal information or any other information about others.
* Use or attempt to gain access to or use another’s user or company account, password, data, or computer systems or networks connected to any Catalyst Services server, whether through hacking, password mining or any other means.
* Access or attempt to access any material that you are not authorized to access.
* Make available any files containing materials where you do not own or control, or have not received the necessary licenses to, all intellectual property rights, rights of privacy and publicity and all other rights in and to such materials.
* Use any materials in any manner that infringes any intellectual property rights or other rights of any party.
* Disrupt or interfere with the security of, or otherwise cause harm to, Catalyst Services, Catalyst Materials, systems resources, accounts, passwords, servers or networks connected to or accessible through Catalyst Services or any affiliated or linked sites.

* Prepare, compile, use, download or otherwise copy any Catalyst Services user directory or other user or usage information or any portion thereof, or transmit, provide or otherwise distribute (whether or not for a fee) such directory or information to any third-party.
* Engage in any chain letters, contests, junk e-mail, pyramid schemes, spamming, surveys or any other duplicative or unsolicited messages (commercial or otherwise).

Materials and Services provided by third parties are governed by separate agreements accompanying such materials and services. Playlyfe offers no guarantees and assumes no responsibility or liability of any type with respect to the third-party services, including any liability resulting from incompatibility between a third-party service, Catalyst Materials, the Catalyst Services or another third-party service. You agree that you will not hold Playlyfe responsible or liable with respect to the third-party services.

### Special Treatment for Spammers

In the event of your or others’ access to or use of Catalyst Services or Materials in connection with the transmission of spam unsolicited e-mail or postings in violation of these Terms of Service, you acknowledge and agree that Playlyfe would be irreparably harmed thereunder and that monetary damages would be an insufficient and ineffective remedy; therefore you agree that Playlyfe is entitled to obtain immediate injunctive relief against any such transmission (in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity). Playlyfe may without restriction block, filter or delete unsolicited e-mail.

### Subdomain Squatting

For our Services that allow you to specify a subdomain, you may not engage in subdomain squatting. Service accounts that are inactive for more than 6 months may also be removed without further notice. Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be subdomain squatting are:

- the number Service accounts created
- creating Service accounts for the purpose of preventing others from using those account names
- creating Service accounts for the purpose of selling those account

Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for Service subdomains are also violations and may result in permanent account suspension.

### Restriction and Termination of Use

We may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of the Catalyst Services at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you. To this day, we have never had to do this, and we hope it never happens.

If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your authorization to access or use the Catalyst Services automatically terminates. Any materials downloaded or printed from the Catalyst Services in violation of the Terms of Service must be immediately destroyed.

If you think we removed your access by mistake, get in touch and we’ll give you our reasoning.

### Notification of Copyright Infringement

Playlyfe will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate the accounts of users who infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Playlyfe will investigate notices of copyright infringement and take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Title 17, United States Code, Section 512©(2) (“DMCA”).

If you believe that your work has been used or copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and such infringement is occurring on Catalyst Services or on sites linked to from Catalyst Services, please provide written notification of claimed copyright infringement to [the designated agent for Playlyfe](https://signup.getcatalyst.in/legal/privacy), which must contain the following elements:

* A physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest that is alleged to have been infringed;
* A description of the copyrighted work or works that you claim have been infringed and identification of what content in such work(s) is claimed to be infringing and which you request to be removed or access to which is to be disabled;
* A description of where the content that you claim is infringing is located on a Catalyst Service;
* Information sufficient to permit Playlyfe to contact you, such as your physical address, telephone number, and e-mail address;

## General

The Terms of Use and other rules, guidelines, licenses and disclaimers posted via Catalyst or in connection with the Materials and Services constitute the entire agreement between Playlyfe and you with respect to your access to or use of the Catalyst service and materials superseding any prior agreements between you and Playlyfe on such subject matter (including any prior versions of the Terms of Use). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any terms set forth in the Terms of Use expressly contradict any terms of a written agreement between you and Playlyfe regarding the use of specific Services or Materials (including Service-specific terms of use and Software-specific licenses) (“Executed Agreement”), such contradictory terms set forth in the Executed Agreement shall govern. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use other Playlyfe services, third-party content or third-party software. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms of Use, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties as reflected by that provision, and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect. Any failure by Playlyfe to enforce or exercise any provision of the Terms of Use or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. The section titles used in the Terms of Use are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect.
