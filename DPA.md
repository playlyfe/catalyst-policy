### 3. Customer Responsibility

Within the scope of the Agreement and in its use of the services, Controller shall be solely responsible for complying with the statutory requirements relating to data protection and privacy, in particular regarding the disclosure and transfer of Personal Data to the Processor and the Processing of Personal Data. For the avoidance of doubt, Controller’s instructions for the Processing of Personal Data shall comply with the Data Protection Law. This DPA is Customer’s complete and final instruction to Playlyfe in relation to Personal Data and that additional instructions outside the scope of DPA would require prior written agreement between the parties. Instructions shall initially be specified in the Agreement and may, from time to time thereafter, be amended, amplified or replaced by Controller in separate written instructions (as individual instructions).

Controller shall inform Processor without undue delay and comprehensively about any errors or irregularities related to statutory provisions on the Processing of Personal Data.

### 4. Obligations of Processor

a. **Compliance with Instructions**. The parties acknowledge and agree that Customer is the Controller of Personal Data and Playlyfe is the Processor of that data. Processor shall collect, process and use Personal Data only within the scope of Controller’s Instructions. If the Processor believes that an Instruction of the Controller infringes the Data Protection Law, it shall immediately inform the Controller without delay. If Processor cannot process Personal Data in accordance with the Instructions due to a legal requirement under any applicable European Union or Member State law, Processor will (i) promptly notify the Controller of that legal requirement before the relevant Processing to the extent permitted by the Data Protection Law; and (ii) cease all Processing (other than merely storing and maintaining the security of the affected Personal Data) until such time as the Controller issues new instructions with which Processor is able to comply. If this provision is invoked, Processor will not be liable to the Controller under the Agreement for any failure to perform the applicable services until such time as the Controller issues new instructions in regard to the Processing.

b. **Security**. Processor shall take the appropriate technical and organizational measures to adequately protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data, described under Appendix 2 to the Standard Contractual Clauses. Such measures include, but are not be limited to:

i. the prevention of unauthorized persons from gaining access to Personal Data Processing systems,

ii. the prevention of Personal Data Processing systems from being used without authorization,

iii. ensuring that persons entitled to use a Personal Data Processing system gain access only to such Personal Data as they are entitled to accessing in accordance with their access rights, and that, in the course of Processing or use and after storage, Personal Data cannot be read, copied, modified or deleted without authorization,

iv. ensuring that Personal Data cannot be read, copied, modified or deleted without authorization during electronic transmission, transport or storage on storage media, and that the target entities for any transfer of Personal Data by means of data transmission facilities can be established and verified,

v. ensuring the establishment of an audit trail to document whether and by whom Personal Data have been entered into, modified in, or removed from Personal Data Processing systems,

vi. ensuring that Personal Data is Processed solely in accordance with the Instructions,

vii. ensuring that Personal Data is protected against accidental destruction or loss.

Processor will facilitate Controller’s compliance with the Controller’s obligation to implement security measures with respect to Personal Data (including if applicable Controller’s obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 34 (inclusive) of the GDPR), by (i) implementing and maintaining the security measures described under Appendix 2, (ii) complying with the terms of Section 4.d. (Personal Data Breaches); and (iii) providing the Controller with information in relation to the Processing in accordance with Section 5 (Audits).

c. **Confidentiality**. Processor shall ensure that any personnel whom Processor authorizes to process Personal Data on its behalf is subject to confidentiality obligations with respect to that Personal Data. The undertaking to confidentiality shall continue after the termination of the above-entitled activities.

d. **Personal Data Breaches**. Processor will notify the Controller as soon as practicable after it becomes aware of any Personal Data Breach affecting any Personal Data. At the Controller’s request, Processor will promptly provide the Controller with all reasonable assistance necessary to enable the Controller to notify relevant Personal Data Breaches to competent authorities and/or affected Data Subjects, if Controller is required to do so under the Data Protection Law.

e. **Data Subject Requests**. Processor will provide reasonable assistance, including by appropriate technical and organizational measures and taking into account the nature of the Processing, to enable Controller to respond to any request from Data Subjects seeking to exercise their rights under the Data Protection Law with respect to Personal Data (including access, rectification, restriction, deletion or portability of Personal Data, as applicable), to the extent permitted by the law.  If such request is made directly to Processor, Processor will promptly inform Controller and will advise Data Subjects to submit their request to the Controller. Controller shall be solely responsible for responding to any Data Subjects’ requests.

To the extent that Controller does not have the ability to address a Data Subject request, then upon Controller’s request Processor shall provide reasonable assistance to the Controller to facilitate such Data Subject request to the extent able and only as required by applicable Data Protection Law. Controller shall reimburse Processor for the commercially reasonable costs arising from this assistance.

f. **Deletion or Retrieval of Personal Data**. Other than to the extent required to comply with Data Protection Law, following termination or expiration of the Agreement, Processor will delete or return all Personal Data (including copies thereof) processed pursuant to this DPA. If Processor is unable to delete Personal Data for technical or other reasons, Processor will apply measures to ensure that Personal Data is blocked from any further Processing.

Controller shall, upon termination or expiration of the Agreement and by way of issuing an Instruction, stipulate, within a period of time set by Processor, the reasonable measures to return data or to delete stored data. Any additional cost arising in connection with the return or deletion of Personal Data after the termination or expiration of the Agreement shall be borne by Controller.

g. **Data Protection Impact Assessments and Consultation with Supervisory Authorities**. To the extent that the required information is available to Processor and the Controller does not otherwise have access to the required information, Processor will provide reasonable assistance to Controller with any data protection impact assessments, and prior consultations with supervisory authorities or other competent data privacy authorities, which Controller reasonably considers to be required by article 35 or 36 of the GDPR or equivalent provisions of any other Data Protection Law, in each case solely in relation to the processing of Personal Data.

### 5. Audits

Processor shall, in accordance with Data Protection Laws and in response to a reasonable written request by Controller, make available to Controller such information in Processor’s possession or control related to Processor’s compliance with the obligations of data processors under Data Protection Law in relation to its Processing of Personal Data.

Controller may, upon written request and at least 30 days’ notice to Processor, during regular business hours and without interrupting Processor’s business operations, conduct an inspection of Processor’s business operations or have the same conducted by a qualified third party auditor subject to Processor’s approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Processor shall, upon Controller’s written request and on at least 30 days’ notice to the Processor, provide Controller with all information necessary for such audit, to the extent that such information is within Processor’s control and Processor is not precluded from disclosing it by applicable law, a duty of confidentiality, or any other obligation owed to a third party.

### 6. Sub-Processors

a. **Appointment of Sub-Processors**. Controller acknowledges and agrees to (a) the engagement as Sub-Processors of Processor’s affiliated companies and the third parties listed in our Sub-Processors List, and (b) that Processor and Processor’s affiliated companies respectively may engage third-party Sub-Processors in connection with the provision of the Catalyst Services. For the avoidance of doubt, the above authorization constitutes Controller’s prior written consent to the sub-Processing by Processor for purposes of Clause 11 of the Standard Contractual Clauses.

Where Processor engages Sub-Processors, Processor will enter into a contract with the Sub-Processor that imposes on the Sub-Processor the same obligations that apply to Processor under this DPA. Where the Sub-Processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations, Processor will remain liable to the Controller for the performance of such Sub-Processors obligations.

Where a Sub-Processor is engaged, the Controller must be granted the right to monitor and inspect the Sub-Processor’s activities in accordance with this DPA and the Data Protection Law, including to obtain information from the Processor, upon written request, on the substance of the contract and the implementation of the data protection obligations under the sub-Processing contract, where necessary by inspecting the relevant contract documents.

The provisions of this Section 6 shall mutually apply if the Processor engages a Sub-Processor in a country outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) not recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data.  If, in the performance of this DPA, Playlyfe transfers any Personal Data to a Sub-Processor located outside of the EEA, Playlyfe shall, in advance of any such transfer, ensure that a legal mechanism to achieve adequacy in respect of that processing is in place.

b. **Current Processor List and Notification or Objection to New Sub-Processors**. If the Processor intends to instruct Sub-Processors other than the companies listed on the Sub-Processors List, the Processor will notify the Controller by updating the Sub-Processors List and will give the Controller the opportunity to object to the engagement of the new Sub-Processors within 30 days after being notified. The objection must be based on reasonable grounds. If the Processor and Controller are unable to resolve such objection, either party may terminate the Agreement by providing written notice to the other party. Controller shall receive a refund of any prepaid but unused fees for the period following the effective date of termination.

### 7. Data Transfers

The Standard Contractual Clauses at Exhibit 1 will apply with respect to Personal Data that is transferred outside the EEA, either directly or via onward transfer, to any country not recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data (as described in the Data Protection Law).

### 8. General Provisions

In case of any conflict, this DPA shall take precedence over the regulations of the Agreement. Where individual provisions of this DPA are invalid or unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of this DPA shall not be affected.

Upon the incorporation of this DPA into the Agreement, the parties indicated in Section 7 below (Parties to this DPA) are agreeing to the Standard Contractual Clauses (where and as applicable) and all appendixes attached thereto. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this DPA and the Standard Contractual Clauses in Exhibit 1, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail, provided however: (a) Controller may exercise its right of audit under clause 5(f) of the standard contractual clauses as set out in, and subject to the requirements of, section 5 of this DPA; and (b) Processor may appoint Sub-Processors as set out, and subject to the requirements of, section 4 and section 6 of this DPA.

### 9. Parties to this DPA

This DPA is an amendment to and forms part of the Agreement. Upon the incorporation of this DPA into the Agreement (i) Controller and Playlyfe are each a party to this DPA, and (ii) to the extent that Playlyfe is not the party to the Agreement, Playlyfe is a party to this DPA, but only with respect to agreement to the Standard Contractual Clauses of the DPA, this Section 7 of the DPA, and to the Standard Contractual Clauses themselves.

If Playlyfe is not a party to the Agreement, the section of the Agreement entitled ‘Limitation of Liability’ shall apply as between Controller and Playlyfe.

The legal entity agreeing to this DPA as Controller represents that it is authorized to agree to and enter into this DPA for, and is agreeing to this DPA solely on behalf of, the Controller.

**Liability**

1. The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or sub-processor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.

2. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his sub-processor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.
The data importer may not rely on a breach by a sub-processor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.

3. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the sub-processor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the sub-processor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data sub-processor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the sub-processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

*Clause 7*

**Mediation and jurisdiction**

1. The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:

2. The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.

*Clause 8*

**Cooperation with supervisory authorities**

1. The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.

2. The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any sub-processor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.

3. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any sub-processor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any sub-processor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5(b).

*Clause 9*

**Governing law**

The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

*Clause 10*

**Variation of the contract**

The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.

*Clause 11*

**Subprocessing**

1. The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the sub-processor which imposes the same obligations on the sub-processor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses. Where the sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations under such agreement.

2. The prior written contract between the data importer and the sub-processor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the sub-processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

3. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

4. The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5(j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter’s data protection supervisory authority.

*Clause 12*

**Obligation after the termination of personal data-processing services**

1. The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data-processing services, the data importer and the sub-processor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.

2. The data importer and the sub-processor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data-processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.
